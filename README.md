# AQ Midi Keyboard
A simple generic midi keyboard Bitwig controller script with some extra features like transpose notes and multi note mode.

## Transpose notes
It just transpose the notes, so it should be in scale.

## Multinote mode
Simple multinote, so hitting one key will play two notes. Just the "Perfect fifth" and play some chords :)
